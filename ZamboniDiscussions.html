<h1><b>What car does Sean drive?</b></h1>
<p>Sean used to drive a 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee when he first got his license. It had over 150,000 miles and seemed to break down everyday he tried to drive it. Functionally, it was one of the worst cars he has ever seen, but it had a lot of character and Sean was not happy to let it go when it broke down for the final time. Now, acquired by trading in the Jeep, he drives a Cadillac XTS with 100,000 miles which seems to have no character or life to it at all.</p>
