<h1 id="div1"><b><i><u>Sean's Plan For After High School</i></u></b></h1>
<p id="div1">After Graduating from Abington High School, Sean will go to college. He has no clue where he will go, but has aslready started thinking about what he will study. It would be safe for Sean to major in finance or business, but that type of stuff has always bored him. What he wants to do is study either computer science or engineering. Both options have signfigant pros and cons that he is considering. He prefers the content seen in the computer science field, but he knows a degree under the computer science umbrella will be worth signifigantly less and less every year. This is because of artificial intelligence being better than the majority of humans when it comes to dealing with computer. Sean knows he can still find success in this field, but it will be a lot more competitive. On the other hand, an engineering degree is more secure, yet still a very difficult field to master. Where Sean goes will depend on what major chooses and what programs different schools offer him. Preferably, Sean would like to do a 3+1 program so that he won't have to pay for 2 extra years for his masters. Some colleges Sean has been looking at are UMASS Amherst, WPI, Boston University, and more. </p>

<h1 id="div1"><i><b><u>After College</i></u></b></h1>
<p id="div1">After graduating with his masters, Sean hopes to begin at a challenging and well paid job immediately. Sean hopes to have the experience necessary from interning over the summer while in college. This job will give him even more experience making him even more qualified for higher quality jobs in the future. His focus will be on putting as much money as he can to paying off any potential college loan debt while still saving as much as he possibly can. To ensure his financial security, he plans to put his saved money towards investments which will steadily increase his income over time setting himself up for future success.</p>

<h1 id="div1"><i><u><b>20 Years From Now</b></i></u></h1>
<p id="div1">20 years from now, Sean hopes to be retired from his day job. It's not likely that he'll have enough money to live off of for the rest of his life, but he hopes to have enough where simply grow his income off of asset investments. Wanting to get away from the cold winters, Sean hopes to move South, but still on the East Coast. Sean just wants to work hard enough through and after college to not have to constantly worry about his financial situation and to be able to afford things without having to save up for them. </p>
